| 2026-07-07 02:30 UTC | Flux reconciled at `71949bf` — both vLLM deployments scaled to 0/0 |
| 2026-07-07 02:32 UTC | First job pod `zpv8w` Pending — FailedScheduling: Insufficient memory (32Gi request) |
| 2026-07-07 02:35 UTC | Fixed memory request 32Gi→8Gi, pushed `0f12863`, deleted old job |
| 2026-07-07 02:57 UTC | Pod `kz686` Running — `pip install speculators` started |
| 2026-07-07 03:05 UTC | **CRASH** — `set -euo pipefail` tripped: scripts not in pip wheel, `git` not in vllm image |
| 2026-07-07 03:05 UTC | Root cause: `speculators v0.6.0` wheel doesn't bundle `scripts/`; `git` absent in vllm image |
| 2026-07-07 03:05 UTC | Job hit `BackoffLimitExceeded` after 5 container restarts in ~5 min |
| 2026-07-07 03:08 UTC | Fix: replace `git clone` fallback with `curl` downloads of individual scripts from GitHub raw |
| 2026-07-07 03:08 UTC | Pushed `3710258`, deleted failed job, triggered Flux reconcile |
| 2026-07-07 03:12 UTC | Pod `wm47q` Running — `pip install speculators` started |
| 2026-07-07 03:13 UTC | `speculators v0.6.0` installed OK; scripts downloaded via curl |
| 2026-07-07 03:13 UTC | `prepare_data.py` skipped — `token_freq.pt` already on PVC from first run |
| 2026-07-07 03:13 UTC | vLLM (port 8001, util=0.35) starting — loading Qwen3.6-27B-NVFP4 |
| 2026-07-07 03:22 UTC | **CRASH** — `VllmConfig` ValidationError: ExampleHiddenStatesConnector incompatible with `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True` |
| 2026-07-07 03:22 UTC | Root cause confirmed via `dspark-real-test` pod (foreground vLLM + HF_TOKEN + GPU) |
| 2026-07-07 04:10 UTC | Fix: unset PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF before vLLM launch, restore before train.py |
| 2026-07-07 04:10 UTC | Pushed fix, deleted failed job, triggered new reconcile |

## Issues Encountered

### Issue 3: ExampleHiddenStatesConnector incompatible with expandable_segments:True
- **Symptom:** Pod `wm47q` CrashLoopBackOff, vllm.log only showed warnings, no traceback
- **Root cause:** vLLM v0.24.0 spawns the API server as a subprocess; subprocess output is NOT captured when vLLM runs backgrounded with `> vllm.log 2>&1`. Diagnosed with `dspark-real-test` pod (foreground, no output redirect).
- **Actual error:** `pydantic_core.ValidationError: KV connector ExampleHiddenStatesConnector is incompatible with PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True unless enable_cumem_allocator is also enabled`
- **Fix:** In train.sh, `unset PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF` before calling `launch_vllm.py`, then `export PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True` before `train.py` (the trainer benefits from it, vLLM does not)
- **Why capture failed:** `launch_vllm.py` uses `os.execvp()` to replace itself with vLLM; the spawned API server subprocess (pid=80) writes to its own stdout, which bypasses the `> vllm.log` redirect of the launcher process

### Issue 1: Memory request too large (32Gi)
- **Symptom:** First pod `zpv8w` stuck in Pending with `Insufficient memory`
- **Root cause:** Node has ~32GB total CPU RAM; 9GB already claimed by other pods; 32Gi request left no headroom
- **Fix:** Reduced requests to `8Gi` — GPU VRAM handles model tensors, CPU RAM only needs ~8Gi for dataloader workers

### Issue 2: `git` not installed in vllm image; scripts not in pip wheel
- **Symptom:** Pod `kz686` CrashLoopBackOff, BackoffLimitExceeded after ~5 min
- **Root cause:** `speculators v0.6.0` does not bundle `scripts/` in the PyPI wheel. The fallback `git clone` silently failed (git absent from `vllm/vllm-openai:v0.24.0`). `set -euo pipefail` then tripped when train.py was missing.
- **Fix:** Replace git clone with curl downloads of individual script files from `raw.githubusercontent.com/vllm-project/speculators/main/scripts`
- **Note:** `token_freq.pt` (from `prepare_data.py`) survived on the PVC — data prep step was completed before the crash, not wasted

## Next Steps After This Run

1. Benchmark: `python scripts/evaluate/evaluate.py throughput --target http://vllm.hoam.lan --dataset RedHatAI/speculator_benchmarks`
2. Compare `acceptance_length` vs z-lab DFlash baseline (HumanEval: 8.9, MBPP: 7.6)
3. If acceptance_length < 4.0 at epoch 3: try `--loss-fn '{"tv": 1.0}'` or lower LR
4. If good results: upload to HuggingFace, update `vllm.yaml` to `method: dspark`
5. Future iterations: more data (ultrachat 200K or Magpie-Qwen3-Pro), more draft layers (5)
